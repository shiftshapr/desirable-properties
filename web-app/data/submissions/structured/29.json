    "title": "IETF-Inspired Governance Framework for the Meta-Layer Initiative",
    "overview": "This submission draws from IETF processes as possible templates for Meta-Layer evolution and proposes both clarifications/extensions to existing Desirable Properties (DPs) and a new DP. It emphasizes reflexive meta-governance, transparent contextualization, and living governance patterns inspired by proven open-source governance models. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",

      "title": "Dynamic Governance as Reflexive Meta-Governance",
      "clarification": "Dynamic governance should include not only the governance of interfaces or overlays but also the participatory and reflexive design of the governance system itself. Governance must evolve through open-ended iteration of its own protocols, roles, and legitimacy mechanisms—such as NomCom and RFCs—ensuring adaptability and participant inclusion over time.",
      "why_it_matters": "This reflexive structure allows governance to remain relevant and trustworthy even as the system and community scale."

      "title": "Legitimation Through Reflexive Process",
      "clarification": "Legitimacy stems from well-documented, accessible, and participatory processes like the IETF's RFC and DataTracker ecosystems. Legitimation should evolve through open critique and contextual responsiveness, not static authority.",
      "why_it_matters": "Processes that evolve in tandem with the community foster legitimacy and resilience over time."

      "clarification": "Transparency must include access to decision lineage, dissent paths, and sociocultural governance rituals like humming and deliberation. Transparency should capture not only outcomes but also the procedural and cultural fabric from which they emerge.",
      "why_it_matters": "Contextualizing decisions helps future contributors understand and evolve them meaningfully."

      "clarification": "Community ownership should encompass governance and purpose-declaration mechanisms as well as interface infrastructure. Meta-institutions themselves must be openly steered and accountable to the community of contributors.",
      "why_it_matters": "Shared ownership of governance reinforces legitimacy and prevents institutional capture."
