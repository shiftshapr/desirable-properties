    "title": "Integrating Multi-Modal Systems into the Meta-Layer Framework",
    "overview": "This submission introduces a new Desirable Property (DP21) to the Meta-Layer framework, emphasizing the necessity for systems capable of overlaying and integrating conceptual, spatial, and virtual information across physical, digital, and emerging AGI domains. Drawing from Dr. Paul Werbos's vision of a 'New Jerusalem'—a global, multi-layered sensor and intelligence network—we highlight the importance of multi-modal integration for enhanced situational awareness, governance, and collaborative intelligence. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3 Based on: https://drpauljohn.blogspot.com/2025/04/from-golden-dome-to-new-jerusalem.html",
