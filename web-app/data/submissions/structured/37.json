    "title": "Family-Centered Introduction of the Meta-Layer for Safer, Co-Creative Internet Engagement",
    "overview": "This submission proposes a public introduction strategy for the Meta-Layer and the Overweb that centers on families—parents, children, and teenagers—by addressing their everyday digital challenges and aspirations. It emphasizes trust-based engagement over restriction, promoting an environment where youth can safely explore, learn, and contribute meaningfully to the co-creation of digital culture. Rather than pursuing institutional entry points (e.g., via schools or governments), this strategy focuses on engaging family media—parenting magazines, youth outlets, school take-home materials—with an invitation to participate. The initiative envisions the Meta-Layer as a viable alternative to the corporate internet, providing young people with a healthier, more creative, and civically empowered online life. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",

      "clarification": "This proposal expands 'education' beyond institutional curricula to include home-based, peer-led, and informal learning. Parents become curators and facilitators, offering their children a civic internet alternative through simple actions like sharing flyers or recommending the Meta-Layer to educators.",
      "why_it_matters": "This distributed model builds long-term familiarity and normalization of the Meta-Layer, empowering youth to integrate it across different areas of life—school, home, and community—without waiting for top-down institutional reform."

      "title": "Press-Driven Family Campaigns",
      "extension": "Rather than relying on tech-centric or policy-focused channels, this submission advocates using widely read family media outlets as primary vectors of adoption. Press kits, parenting articles, and youth-oriented features can provide narrative bridges into the Meta-Layer.",
      "why_it_matters": "These channels are low-cost, high-reach, and trusted by parents. They offer a fast route to community-scale adoption while reinforcing the Meta-Layer's values of care, creativity, and shared stewardship."
