    "title": "AI as the Ultimate Safety Layer",
    "overview": "Digital crimes—scams, phishing, deepfakes, and sophisticated social-engineered fraud—are rapidly escalating in complexity and frequency. Rather than viewing AI as merely exacerbating these threats, this submission proposes an OS-level 'Safety Agent,' a localized AI capable of proactively detecting digital threats, providing mental health interventions, improving personal judgment, and enabling enterprise compliance without compromising privacy. By operating solely on-device and integrated at the operating system level, this solution maximizes data security and user trust. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3 Based on article by Scott Belsky: https://www.implications.com/p/the-emergence-of-safety-layers-religion",
