    "title": "Enabling Machine-Readable Meaning through the Semantic Web",
    "overview": "This submission revisits the seminal 2001 vision of the Semantic Web, proposing its relevance and expanded applicability to modern decentralized meta-systems. It explores how the foundational architecture of the Semantic Web—built on distributed knowledge representation, interoperable ontologies, and machine-readable logic—prefigures the infrastructure needed for scalable, composable, and user-aligned digital environments. The submission identifies alignment with multiple Desirable Properties, especially regarding knowledge portability, participatory governance, and ethical agentic systems. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",
