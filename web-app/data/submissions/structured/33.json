    "title": "Chromium Reputation Provider Framework: A Decentralized Reputation Layer for the Web",
    "overview": "This draft proposal from the Chromium team outlines a browser-native framework enabling users to install, manage, and utilize multiple independent reputation providers. It envisions a decentralized ecosystem for reputational signals, facilitating both positive and negative assessments of websites and content. This approach prioritizes user choice, system resilience, and reputational pluralism over centralized moderation or gatekeeping by browser vendors. It aims to replicate the utility of walled-garden trust systems (e.g., Amazon reviews) while retaining the open and user-controlled nature of the web. The framework proposes multiple technical mechanisms for secure and privacy-respecting attestations, enabling scalable and nuanced integration of reputational data into browsing experiences. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",
