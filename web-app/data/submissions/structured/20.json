    "title": "Sixteen Axioms for Cognitive Infrastructure",
    "overview": "This submission offers a distilled suite of sixteen axioms designed to serve as a foundational cognitive infrastructure for the Meta-Layer. These axioms form a substrate for adaptive learning, perception, and tool creation across shifting contexts. Rather than prescribing behavior, they cultivate interpretive strength—guiding participants toward clarity, coherence, and sovereign insight in their engagements with the unknown. These lines may inform curriculum, protocol design, AI-human interfaces, and participatory governance by anchoring development in composable, pluralistic wisdom. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3",

      "type": "Clarification",
      "title": "Axioms as Epistemic Wayfinding",
      "clarification": "This submission reframes education not as knowledge transfer, but as wayfinding through complexity. The sixteen axioms serve as cognitive tuning forks—resonant lines that invite learners to adapt, reinterpret, and deepen their own epistemic autonomy.",
      "why_it_matters": "When epistemic resilience becomes foundational, learners and systems alike can respond to uncertainty with elegance rather than fear. These axioms reduce cognitive fragility while empowering emergence, mutuality, and insight. Education, in this model, becomes a tool for sovereign worldbuilding."
