    "title": "Cultivating Trust in AI-Assisted Online Conversations",
    "overview": "This submission proposes a values-based framework for moderation, reputation, and friction in AI-mediated online discourse. Instead of punitive moderation, the system introduces soft interventions such as modulated visibility and reflection cues. These tools promote respectful, legible, and community-aligned interactions. The design treats moderation as a participatory, adaptive mechanism shaped by community values. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",

Instead of treating moderation as binary (e.g. delete/ban), it introduces values-expressive friction, context-sensitive reputation, and ambient AI mediation as tools to help foster respectful, trustworthy, and legible interactions in online communities. By introducing soft, explainable moderation cuesâ€”like modulated visibility, tone adjustments, or frictional delaysâ€”the system empowers participants to reflect, adjust, and align their behavior with community norms. This framework treats moderation as a participatory design space, not just an enforcement mechanism, and aligns well with AI safety, community governance, and trust-building. ðŸ”¸ Desirable Properties this Proposal Relates To DP11 â€“ Safe and Ethical AI DP12 â€“ Community-based AI Governance DP18 â€“ Feedback Loops and Reputation DP2 â€“ Participant Agency and Empowerment DP14 â€“ Trust and Transparency ðŸ”¸ Suggested Changes, Extensions, or Clarifications DP11 â€“ Safe and Ethical AI Extend to support interaction-level modulation and friction-based trust signaling, helping AI systems cultivate safety within conversation dynamicsâ€”not just through content filters. DP12 â€“ Community-based AI Governance Clarify that AI systems should be responsive to community norms in real-time, and able to adapt mediation strategies based on communal values. DP18 â€“ Feedback Loops and Reputation Extend to include conversational, real-time reputation signals that evolve through dialogue and are visible and understandable to participants. DP2 â€“ Participant Agency and Empowerment Reframe friction and moderation tools as empowerment mechanisms that invite reflection, rather than simply restrict behavior. DP14 â€“ Trust and Transparency Include socially legible trust cues and explainable mediation actions as part of the transparency framework for AI-supported spaces. ðŸ”¸ Why this matters As AI becomes a co-participant in digital discourse, we must ensure its presence enhancesâ€”not erodesâ€”trust, legibility, and collective norms. This proposal introduces design patterns for cultivating healthier AI-mediated interaction by foregrounding social context, values-based friction, and evolving, legible reputation. It calls for a moderation layer that helps us learn to live well with AI, not just control or resist it.\nName: Christopher\nLast name: C Santos-Lang\nShort answer email: langchri@gmail.com\nPlease check all that apply: I used Metta to help craft this submission"
