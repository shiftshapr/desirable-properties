    "title": "Ethical Products for the Global South",
    "overview": "This submission highlights two interlinked challenges: (1) current blockchain and Web3 product models are prohibitively expensive and culturally misaligned for crafts-producing communities in the Global South; (2) lack of interoperable standards risks reinforcing digital colonialism and undermining transformative policies like the EU's Green Deal. The author calls for early standardization and native interoperability, particularly around Digital Product Passports (DPPs), to empower bottom-up adoption and avoid top-down imposition. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",
