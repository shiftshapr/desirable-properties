    "title": "Enhancing Whistleblower Protection within the Meta-Layer",
    "overview": "This submission draws upon established frameworks from WPAC (2015) and Security.org to propose enhancements to whistleblower systems in alignment with the Meta-Layer's Desirable Properties. It emphasizes secure, anonymized federated authentication, user-controlled data sovereignty, interoperable and simplified reporting interfaces, and system-wide transparency and security protocols. These systems are essential to protect whistleblowers from retaliation and to ensure credibility, participation, and systemic accountability. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",
