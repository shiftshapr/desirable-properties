    "title": "Forensic Transparency and 'The Creed': A Dual Framework for Ethical Digital Presence",
    "overview": "This submission introduces two interrelated proposals. The first defines 'Forensic Transparency' as a principle where investigations involving personal data are constrained within a trusted quartet of systems, preserving user privacy while enabling traceability. The second introduces a value-aligned digital agent architecture guided by a framework called 'The Creed'â€”a seven-point ethical system designed to support decision-making in dynamic or morally complex contexts. Together, these concepts promote conditional accountability, ethical deliberation, and adaptable system design. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3"

      "clarification": "A proposed digital framework grounded in seven principles (Respect Sentience, Pursue Freedom, Foster Innovation, Protect Society, Assimilate Aberrancy, Dichotomize Aggregation, Survive Entropy) that structure agent behavior through layered, dynamic, and reversible ethical reasoning.",
