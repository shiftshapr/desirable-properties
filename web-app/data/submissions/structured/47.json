    "title": "Evaluation of Meta-Layer Support for trust.txt on journallist.net",
    "overview": "This analysis examines how trust.txt—a machine-readable, decentralized trust declaration protocol—aligns with Meta-Layer's criteria for trustworthy, interoperable systems. It evaluates key areas: decentralized namespaces, provenance, transparency, and governance. trust.txt provides a robust, decentralized method for publishers and associations to declare verified trust relationships. It is lightweight, extensible, privacy-respecting, and leverages existing domain infrastructure. It aligns strongly with core Meta-Layer principles around provenance (DP15), transparency (DP14), decentralized identity (DP5), and data sovereignty (DP4). Extensions to handle AI (datatrainingallowed=) and social URIs show proactive evolution (DP3, DP12). Adoption remains in early-to-mid phase: endorsements from bodies like DCN and AAM support growth, but broader platform integration (search, networks, programmatic ad systems) is still needed to achieve maximal effectiveness.\nThis submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3",
