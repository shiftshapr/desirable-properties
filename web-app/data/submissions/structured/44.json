    "title": "MetaBridge: An AI Powered, Privacy Respecting Bridge Between Platforms for Civic Collaboration",
    "overview": "As the web becomes increasingly fragmented across platforms, communities and interfaces, there's a growing need for a shared meta layer that can connect intent, identity and impact especially for civic engagement and youth led innovation. MetaBridge is a composable overlay tool that allows users to tag any webpage, forum or social media post with a shared civic topic, overlay context like translated summaries and verifiable endorsements, enable portable participation linked to user wallets or decentralized IDs, respect privacy using zero knowledge proofs, and show presence and support in real time. MetaBridge would serve both as a civic toolkit and a proof of concept for interoperable participation, used by youth groups, NGOs, local governments and DAOs to run cross platform campaigns with full transparency and modular AI support.",

    "raw_content": "MetaBridge: An AI Powered, Privacy Respecting Bridge Between Platforms for Civic Collaboration\n\nAs the web becomes increasingly fragmented across platforms, communities and interfaces, there's a growing need for a shared meta layer that can connect intent, identity and impact especially for civic engagement and youth led innovation.\n\nMy idea is MetaBridge, a composable overlay tool that allows users to:\n1) Tag any webpage, forum or social media post with a shared civic topic for example \"Climate Petition - Nairobi\"\n2) Overlay context like translated summaries, verifiable endorsements, deadlines or decision making status\n3) Enable portable participation, where actions like signing, donating, commenting or voting can happen directly within the overlay, linked securely to user wallets or decentralized IDs\n4) Respect privacy by using zero knowledge proofs or selective disclosure for participation tracking\n5) Show presence and support in real time, creating momentum without platform lock in\n\nMetaBridge would serve both as a civic toolkit and a proof of concept for interoperable participation. It could be used by youth groups, NGOs, local governments and DAOs to run cross platform campaigns, with full transparency and modular AI support.\n\nThis ties into desirable properties like Privacy & Data Sovereignty, Trust & Transparency, Adaptive Governance and AI Accountability.\n\nAs someone active in digital governance circles like ICANN and ISOC, and with experience in AI and open web development, I'm deeply excited about the potential of the MetaLayer to unlock shared digital agency across borders."
