    "title": "Rebranding the Metaweb to Overweb",
    "overview": "This submission addresses a significant brand perception issue: the public confusion between the Metaweb and the Metaverse. The Metaverse, associated with corporate overreach and dystopian imagery, negatively colors first impressions of the Metaweb. This proposal suggests rebranding to a term like 'Overweb'â€”a name that feels assertive, memorable, and true to the vision of an interoperable, human-centered web infrastructure. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",

      "title": "Overweb as Memetic Anchor",
      "clarification": "The term 'Overweb' offers intuitive resonance, framing the Meta-Layer as something above and beyond traditional web systems, and sidestepping metaphoric confusion with dystopian 'Metaverse' narratives.",
      "why_it_matters": "Names shape public discourse. A clear, distinct, and resonant name helps communities rally, media to clarify, and the public to differentiate between extractive and empowering digital futures."
