    "title": "Bridges, Synaptic Web, and Universal Maps: Toward a Cognitive Meta-layer",
    "overview": "This multi-part proposal outlines an architectural evolution of the web through three interconnected primitives: 1) Bridges as first-class web infrastructure, 2) The Synaptic Web as an adaptive, evolving collective intelligence, and 3) Universal knowledge maps for navigation, learning, and sensemaking. Together, these ideas transform the Meta-layer into a dynamic scaffold for contextual intelligence, verifiable information, and community co-creation. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",
