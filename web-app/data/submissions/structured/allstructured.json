        "overview": "As the web becomes increasingly fragmented across platforms, communities and interfaces, there's a growing need for a shared meta layer that can connect intent, identity and impact especially for civic engagement and youth led innovation. MetaBridge is a composable overlay tool that allows users to tag any webpage, forum or social media post with a shared civic topic, overlay context like translated summaries and verifiable endorsements, enable portable participation linked to user wallets or decentralized IDs, respect privacy using zero knowledge proofs, and show presence and support in real time. MetaBridge would serve both as a civic toolkit and a proof of concept for interoperable participation, used by youth groups, NGOs, local governments and DAOs to run cross platform campaigns with full transparency and modular AI support.",

It could be used by youth groups, NGOs, local governments and DAOs to run cross platform campaigns, with full transparency and modular AI support.\n\nThis ties into desirable properties like Privacy & Data Sovereignty, Trust & Transparency, Adaptive Governance and AI Accountability.\n\nAs someone active in digital governance circles like ICANN and ISOC, and with experience in AI and open web development, I'm deeply excited about the potential of the MetaLayer to unlock shared digital agency across borders."

By ensuring participants can optionally route their interactions, contributions, and identity resolution processes through a resilient, trust-minimized VPN mesh, the Meta-Layer can enhance privacy, resist surveillance, and uphold autonomy without sacrificing usability or speed.\n\nDirectly Addressed Desirable Properties:\n\nDP2 - Participant Agency and Empowerment: Participants retain control over their network footprint and gain optional anonymity without losing functional parity.\n\nDP4 - Data Sovereignty and Privacy: Enabling a native privacy VPN ensures that user data remains local, obfuscated, and untracked by default.\n\nDP7 - Simplicity and Interoperability: This VPN module would be plug-and-play, operable across Meta-Layer protocols without additional configuration.\n\nDP15 - Security and Provenance: A decentralized VPN reduces attack vectors and metadata leaks, improving the baseline security posture of the Meta-Layer.\n\nDP6 - Commerce: The VPN layer may participate in a tokenized economy, enabling monetization of privacy routing services.\n\nDP17 - Financial Sustainability: Incentivizing VPN node operation offers a sustainable privacy infrastructure for the Meta-Layer over time.\n\nClarifications & Extensions:\n\nDP4 – Data Sovereignty and Privacy: Mesh VPN as Privacy Backbone\nClarification: The VPN is not merely a user tool but an infrastructural feature, integrated at the protocol layer and distributed across participating nodes, using multiparty relays and onion routing as baseline standards.\nWhy it matters: Treating privacy as a core service ensures it is not marginalized or made contingent on technical skill, financial access, or third-party dependencies.\n\nDP15 – Security and Provenance: Metadata Obfuscation as Provenance Control\nExtension: The VPN system includes ephemeral routing logs with user-controlled retention policies, enhancing the user's ability to audit their own metadata while denying others blanket access.\nWhy it matters: Provenance must include the right to withhold information about origin paths in sensitive contexts, and this approach aligns that goal with network-layer tooling.\n\nDP7 – Simplicity and Interoperability: BYO-VPN Compatibility Layer\nExtension: In addition to offering a native privacy VPN, the Meta-Layer should define a standard interface allowing participants to integrate external VPNs or anonymity layers without requiring custom configuration or loss of functionality.\nWhy it matters: Many users already trust and rely on their own privacy infrastructure. Ensuring compatibility avoids fragmentation, respects user choice, and maintains protocol-agnostic simplicity.\n\nDP6 – Commerce: Privacy VPN as a Meta-Layer Service Market\nExtension: If the default VPN is not free, the Meta-Layer could enable a microtransaction-based model where users pay per session or bandwidth unit using tokens, with commissions shared between node operators and the Meta-Layer treasury. Alternatively, participants could route through third-party VPNs integrated via the BYO-VPN standard, with opt-in revenue sharing agreements.\nWhy it matters: This creates a privacy-respecting economic incentive model while avoiding centralization of control. It also encourages node participation and maintains user flexibility.\n\nDP17 – Financial Sustainability: Incentivized Privacy Infrastructure\nExtension: Routing traffic through privacy-enhancing relays becomes a revenue-generating role for network participants, sustaining the VPN mesh without relying on external funding or coercive monetization.\nWhy it matters: Embedding optional economic incentives directly into the privacy layer aligns long-term viability with user empowerment and network resilience."

It evaluates key areas: decentralized namespaces, provenance, transparency, and governance. trust.txt provides a robust, decentralized method for publishers and associations to declare verified trust relationships. It is lightweight, extensible, privacy-respecting, and leverages existing domain infrastructure. It aligns strongly with core Meta-Layer principles around provenance (DP15), transparency (DP14), decentralized identity (DP5), and data sovereignty (DP4). Extensions to handle AI (datatrainingallowed=) and social URIs show proactive evolution (DP3, DP12). Adoption remains in early-to-mid phase: endorsements from bodies like DCN and AAM support growth, but broader platform integration (search, networks, programmatic ad systems) is still needed to achieve maximal effectiveness.\nThis submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3",
