      "submission_overview": "I propose the development of a browser-level interface protocol that allows multiple overlays (e.g. assistants, wallets, chat tools) to register themselves into a shared, user-configurable tray, typically anchored in the lower-right corner of the screen. This would support coexistence of decentralized tools, prevent UX collisions, and empower users to customize their digital environment without friction.\n\nOverlays would be able to:\n- Register a “startup icon” and metadata (name, role, permissions)\n- Indicate availability or priority\n- Respect a shared system for tray placement and visibility\n- Defer to user preferences in display and ordering\n\nUsers could:\n- Configure which overlays are pinned or expanded\n- Access others on demand via an expandable tray\n- Rely on consistent placement and behavior across sites and browsers\n\nNext Steps: I suggest forming a W3C Community Group to define an open standard for overlay registration and tray coordination. This standard could help browsers and web apps harmonize decentralized UI layers, supporting both open innovation and excellent UX.",

For centuries, scholars and readers have annotated Shakespeare’s plays with footnotes and glosses. Yet, most online editions—including high-traffic projects like Open Source Shakespeare—lack accessible footnotes. This effort would establish a collaborative, trusted, and extensible annotation system allowing footnotes and glosses to be layered directly onto public web texts. With a focus on educational value, transparency, and collaborative authorship, this system would begin with Shakespeare but extend to other canonical and public domain texts.

This submission proposes a dual-entry approach to introduce the Meta-Layer and the Overweb to broad audiences by focusing on two interrelated use cases: education and journalism. First, in the school sector—particularly across Europe—project-based learning environments can integrate Meta-Layer tools to foster youth engagement with a safer, purpose-driven, and participatory web. Second, Scandinavia represents a particularly fertile region for a journalist-specific integration of the Meta-Layer. With strong traditions of collaborative civic culture, peaceful education systems, and relatively depolarized journalism ecosystems, countries like Denmark and Sweden could pioneer the use of a dedicated journalistic layer. This would empower newsrooms to verify content, trace sources, and resist the creep of misinformation. These use cases are mutually reinforcing and could provide a resilient first foothold for broader adoption. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",
