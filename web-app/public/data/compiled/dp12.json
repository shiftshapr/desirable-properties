      "submission_overview": "Vicariance, drawn from biological systems, describes how temporary divisions in ecosystems allow novel or fragile designs to incubate before facing widespread exposure or competition. This submission proposes Vicariance as a desirable meta-layer property — one that would enable safe experimentation and staged integration of innovations, ideas, and social formations within decentralized digital networks. It suggests resisting immediate global unification to maintain diverse paths of emergence. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",

NUIs propose a federated ecosystem of navigation frameworks allowing pluralistic learning, interaction, and AI-guided exploration, grounded in a shared regular panel.
