This would support coexistence of decentralized tools, prevent UX collisions, and empower users to customize their digital environment without friction.\n\nOverlays would be able to:\n- Register a “startup icon” and metadata (name, role, permissions)\n- Indicate availability or priority\n- Respect a shared system for tray placement and visibility\n- Defer to user preferences in display and ordering\n\nUsers could:\n- Configure which overlays are pinned or expanded\n- Access others on demand via an expandable tray\n- Rely on consistent placement and behavior across sites and browsers\n\nNext Steps: I suggest forming a W3C Community Group to define an open standard for overlay registration and tray coordination. This standard could help browsers and web apps harmonize decentralized UI layers, supporting both open innovation and excellent UX.",
