This would support coexistence of decentralized tools, prevent UX collisions, and empower users to customize their digital environment without friction.\n\nOverlays would be able to:\n- Register a “startup icon” and metadata (name, role, permissions)\n- Indicate availability or priority\n- Respect a shared system for tray placement and visibility\n- Defer to user preferences in display and ordering\n\nUsers could:\n- Configure which overlays are pinned or expanded\n- Access others on demand via an expandable tray\n- Rely on consistent placement and behavior across sites and browsers\n\nNext Steps: I suggest forming a W3C Community Group to define an open standard for overlay registration and tray coordination.

Second, Scandinavia represents a particularly fertile region for a journalist-specific integration of the Meta-Layer. With strong traditions of collaborative civic culture, peaceful education systems, and relatively depolarized journalism ecosystems, countries like Denmark and Sweden could pioneer the use of a dedicated journalistic layer.

Instead of punitive moderation, the system introduces soft interventions such as modulated visibility and reflection cues. These tools promote respectful, legible, and community-aligned interactions. The design treats moderation as a participatory, adaptive mechanism shaped by community values. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",
