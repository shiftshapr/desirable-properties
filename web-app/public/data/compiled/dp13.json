Most AI systems today — even those using RAG or agent-based architectures — lack persistent, intelligent memory. They retrieve information but don’t maintain continuity. DiCAMS solves this by generating a dynamic memory graph that grows and adapts with user input, real-world data, and contextual signals. Think of it as a scaffolded memory system that doesn’t just store — it organizes, summarizes, and forgets intelligently.\n\nWhere this matters most:\n- Healthcare: longitudinal patient data contextualization\n- Enterprise AI: evolving knowledge workflows\n- Agent ecosystems: shared context and alignment\n\nDiCAMS acts like a smart librarian — not only filing information but writing the index, linking the chapters, and updating the story as it unfolds. It’s not just a better retrieval system. It’s a meta-layer for cognition — the missing infrastructure for truly intelligent, user-aligned AI.\n\nThis submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3",

Through the design, implementation, and evaluation of \"NDN Workspace,\" the work demonstrates how semantic naming, data-centric security, and distributed data synchronization can enable direct, secure, and serverless peer-to-peer collaboration. The study also contributes critical insights into naming schemes, trust schema enforcement, and the broader ecosystem architecture required to support real-time collaborative applications outside the cloud paradigm.
