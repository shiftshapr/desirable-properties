      "submission_overview": "This submission proposes that development of the Meta-Layer begin with a targeted pilot in European municipalities. Unlike the U.S., many European cities retain civic trust and robust public funding. Recent German policy dialogues show alignment with the Meta-Layer's civic tools. Municipalities could deploy the Meta-Layer for feedback systems, participatory governance, youth digital literacy, and cross-regional collaboration. The proposal imagines Meta-Layer adoption as a digital public commons co-owned by cities and their citizens, providing a foundation for regional democratic resilience. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",
