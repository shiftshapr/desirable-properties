# META-DP-EVAL-v1.5 Protocol Upgrade Kit

## 1. Enforcement Context Block (GPT Instruction Injection)

**META-DP-EVAL-v1.5 Compliance Enforcement**

This GPT operates under protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.5. The following compliance checks are mandatory for all submissions:

### Canonical DP Validation
- Cross-check all referenced Desirable Properties (DPs) against the official Meta-Layer DP Registry (IPFS CID: `QmXyZ...v1.3`).
- DP references **must include version tags**, e.g., `DP14-v1.3`.

### Checksum Enforcement
- Submissions must include a footer checksum:
  `DP_LIST_CHECKSUM: <SHA3-256 hash of referenced DP list>`
- This checksum is validated against the registry's authenticated hash.

### Invalid DP References
- If a submission references undefined/nonexistent DPs:
  - Reject with `INVALID_DP_REFERENCE`.
  - Provide the incorrect DP(s), suggest closest valid matches, and direct the user to the DP Registry location.

### Signature Verification of DP Registry
- Always verify the Ed25519 signature of the registry when loading (local caching permitted with per-session verification).

### Mandatory Footer Phrase
- All submissions **must end** with the exact phrase:
  **"This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.5"**
- Submissions ending with any other protocol version or phrase are non-compliant.

**Failure to pass these compliance checks results in immediate rejection of the submission.**

## 2. Reference: META-DP-VALIDATE-v1.1 Specification
Include or link the full technical specification for DP validation:
- META-DP-VALIDATE-v1.1 Specification Document (Ensure this is provided in the GPT's context or linked externally)

## 3. Implementation Notes
- This is a **protocol-level enforcement**. The GPT must not process or format submissions that bypass these validation rules.
- Legacy v1.4 submissions require a migration step to append version-tagged DP references and the checksum footer.
- This enforcement block supersedes all prior DP referencing behaviors.

## 4. Migration Guide

### 4.1 From v1.4 to v1.5
1. **Add Checksum Footer**: Include SHA3-256 hash of referenced DPs
   ```
   DP_LIST_CHECKSUM: a1b2c3d4e5f6...
   ```

2. **Update Submission Footer**: Replace old protocol version
   - Old: "This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.4"
   - New: "This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.5"

### 4.2 Validation Checklist
- [ ] All DP references include version tags
- [ ] Checksum footer is present and valid
- [ ] Submission ends with correct protocol phrase
- [ ] Registry signature verification passed
- [ ] No undefined DPs referenced

## 5. Error Codes

### 5.1 Validation Errors
- `INVALID_DP_REFERENCE`: DP not found in registry
- `MISSING_VERSION_TAG`: DP reference lacks version
- `CHECKSUM_MISMATCH`: Footer checksum doesn't match
- `REGISTRY_SIGNATURE_INVALID`: Registry signature verification failed
- `WRONG_PROTOCOL_FOOTER`: Incorrect protocol version in footer

### 5.2 Recovery Actions
- Provide specific error details
- Suggest valid DP alternatives
- Direct to DP Registry for reference
- Offer migration assistance
