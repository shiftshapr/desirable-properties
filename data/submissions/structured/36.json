    "title": "Seeding Generational Familiarity with the Meta-Layer Through Purpose-Driven Educational Use and Scandinavian Journalism Partnerships",
    "overview": "Early Use Case Scandinavian Journalism Newsrooms combined with Seeding Generational Familiarity through Purpose-Driven Use in Education. This submission proposes a dual-entry approach to introduce the Meta-Layer and the Overweb to broad audiences by focusing on two interrelated use cases: education and journalism. First, in the school sector—particularly across Europe—project-based learning environments can integrate Meta-Layer tools to foster youth engagement with a safer, purpose-driven, and participatory web. Second, Scandinavia represents a particularly fertile region for a journalist-specific integration of the Meta-Layer. With strong traditions of collaborative civic culture, peaceful education systems, and relatively depolarized journalism ecosystems, countries like Denmark and Sweden could pioneer the use of a dedicated journalistic layer. This would empower newsrooms to verify content, trace sources, and resist the creep of misinformation. These use cases are mutually reinforcing and could provide a resilient first foothold for broader adoption. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",
