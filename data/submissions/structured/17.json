    "title": "Can Directories Rise Again?",
    "overview": "This submission reflects on the current deteriorating state of web search, emphasizing how AI-generated content and algorithmic prioritization have reduced the human-centric experience of exploration. It draws parallels with the early days of Yahoo! and its surfer-driven directories to propose a revival of decentralized, point-of-view-rich human directories. These directories, distributed across communities rather than centralized institutions, can rekindle authentic discovery and trust online. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",

      "title": "Surfing, Not Culling",
      "clarification": "While traditional curation aims to distill content into elite lists, the proposed surfer-model embraces broader and more inclusive collection. Surfers may embrace abundance and variety, linking generously rather than minimalistically, enabling multi-threaded explorations across topics and interests.",
      "why_it_matters": "This promotes a more vibrant and participatory discovery ecosystem, where communities can grow organically around shared explorations rather than compete for finite slots in a rigid canon."
