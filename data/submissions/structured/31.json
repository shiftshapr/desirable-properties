    "title": "Global Recognition of Prior Learning via Meta-Layer Credentials",
    "overview": "This submission proposes a standardized extension of Recognition of Previous Learning (RPL) by leveraging the badge-based credentialing system of the Meta-Layer. The objective is to create a globally verifiable, interoperable framework that educational institutions can universally recognize, enabling learners to carry validated learning achievements across jurisdictions and systems. The initiative encourages integration with existing academic accreditation bodies while preserving decentralized verification and learner agency. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3",

      "extension": "This extension introduces an open protocol and institutional toolkit for educational bodies to evaluate and formally recognize Meta-Layer badges as equivalent to course credits or certifications. It includes schema translation modules, peer-review validation mechanics, and compatibility scoring.",
      "why_it_matters": "Without institutional recognition, the utility of Meta-Layer credentials remains limited. A cross-system framework enables decentralized learning to materially impact academic progression, career mobility, and policy influence at scale."

      "extension": "Adds a feature allowing third-party educational accreditors to digitally co-sign badge authenticity, improving trust in international or high-stakes credential applications.",
      "why_it_matters": "To gain widespread adoption, especially among conservative institutions, credentials must be both machine-verifiable and humanly trusted. This co-signing mechanism provides a clear audit trail and formal endorsement."
