    "title": "Vicariance as a Desirable Meta-Layer Property",
    "overview": "Vicariance, drawn from biological systems, describes how temporary divisions in ecosystems allow novel or fragile designs to incubate before facing widespread exposure or competition. This submission proposes Vicariance as a desirable meta-layer property — one that would enable safe experimentation and staged integration of innovations, ideas, and social formations within decentralized digital networks. It suggests resisting immediate global unification to maintain diverse paths of emergence. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",

I am suggesting that it would be desirable for the Internet to maintain this property, rather than unify the human population as fast as AI can reach-out to all of us simultaneously.\nPlease check all that apply: I’m open to being contacted about this idea,I'd like my idea put onchain,I can't wait to get my Overweb badge"
