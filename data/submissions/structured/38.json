    "title": "Platform Harms to LGBTQ+ Communities and the Need for Inclusive Meta-Layer Design",
    "overview": "The March 2024 Kairos Fellowship report, User Error: LGBTQ+, documents historical and ongoing harms experienced by LGBTQ+ individuals in digital environments, with emphasis on the erasure and marginalization caused by platform policies and automated moderation systems. Drawing from this analysis, this submission argues for the incorporation of inclusive design principles into the Meta-Layer Initiative, particularly those that protect vulnerable populations. Key recommendations include increasing transparency, empowering community-based governance, and ensuring AI systems respect identity and context.
