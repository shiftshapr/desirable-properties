    "title": "Seeding Generational Familiarity with the Meta-Layer Through Purpose-Driven Educational Use",
    "overview": "This submission proposes a pathway to introduce the Meta-Layer and the Overweb to large youth demographics—particularly through educational institutions in Europe—by integrating its tools into project-based learning. Schools frequently face challenges in teaching safe and meaningful digital participation, often within bleak discussions around bullying, misinformation, and online harm. Offering students a platform that actively embodies the ideals of safe, collaborative, and transparent internet use transforms these discussions into hopeful explorations. Through international student projects on topics like sustainable development, cultural heritage, or local youth leadership, learners could engage with the Meta-Layer's truth-marking tools and bridge systems over time. These students would gain years of formative experience with purpose-aligned digital tools, anchoring future internet use in trust, clarity, and collaborative agency. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",
