    "raw_content": "Title: Sacred Stacks and Post-Extractive Dev Environments\n\nContribution Overview:\nSacred Stacks is an effort to build software environments that reframe code and digital infrastructure as sacred, relational practice. It proposes a post-extractive model of development where communities can co-create and maintain digital tools grounded in ceremony, kinship, and long-term care. Rather than maximizing speed or efficiency, these environments prioritize collective authorship, slow knowledge, and epistemic sovereignty. Dev environments become cultural environments.\nThis submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3\n\nDirectly Addressed Desirable Properties:\n- DP2 – Participant Agency and Empowerment: Communities define the epistemologies and protocols that shape their tooling.\n- DP4 – Data Sovereignty and Privacy: Local-first principles guide data flows and custodianship.\n- DP10 – Education: Learning environments are embedded within the dev stack, encouraging intergenerational transmission.\n- DP14 – Trust and Transparency: Transparent rituals and authoring protocols build trust within and across stacks.\n- DP20 – Community Ownership: Dev environments are stewarded by the communities they serve.\n\nClarifications & Extensions:\n**DP10 – Education: Slow Knowledge and Intergenerational Contexts**\nExtension: Education is treated as a long-term community process. Dev environments support lineage-based learning and non-linear exploration.\nWhy it matters: Helps shift from extractive, market-based skills training to community-authored knowledge ecosystems.\n\n**DP4 – Data Sovereignty and Privacy: Relational Data Ethics**\nClarification: Data governance models incorporate relational and ceremonial constraints, grounded in community-specific ontologies.\nWhy it matters: Expands privacy beyond technical boundaries into cultural and ecological relationships.\n\n(End of Submission)"
