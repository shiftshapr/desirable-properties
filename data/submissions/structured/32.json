    "title": "Levelling the Digital Playing Field: A Meta-Layer for a Post-Capitalist Web",
    "overview": "The web should serve as a planetary commons, empowering individuals rather than extending the dominance of governments or corporate interests. Instead of fueling extractive capitalist agendas, it must foster community resilience and global solidarity. This submission proposes a meta-layer that reorients the web toward cooperative engagement: connecting those in need with those able to help, and enabling flows of knowledge, support, and solutions across divisive boundaries. By doing so, it reclaims the web as a site of mutual aid and regenerative exchange. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",
