    "title": "Humane Design Patterns for Ethical Tech Platforms",
    "overview": "This submission synthesizes practical interface and architectural patterns from the 'Humane Tech Framework' to inform the development of platforms that enhance user agency, attention, relationships, and understanding. The design patterns tackle common harms such as compulsive usage, information overload, and manipulative defaults by emphasizing user wellbeing, transparency, and ethical engagement.

      "title": "Humane Defaults and Progressive Interfaces",
      "extension": "This proposal extends the interpretation of agency to include interface architectures that reduce cognitive burden, promote user-led configuration, and avoid dark patterns. This includes progressive disclosure of settings, focus-enabling modes, and defaults aligned with user wellbeing rather than engagement maximization.",
      "why_it_matters": "Empowerment is not only about offering control, but about making that control understandable, accessible, and non-exploitative. These patterns address the structural design of how agency is experienced."

      "title": "Transparent Algorithmic Affordances",
      "extension": "Transparency is enhanced not only by disclosing inputs and models but also by contextualizing algorithmic decisions through user-facing cards that describe why certain content appears. This pattern integrates educational affordances directly into the interface.",
      "why_it_matters": "Algorithmic systems affect user experiences daily. Without accessible transparency mechanisms, users remain disempowered and skeptical, eroding trust."
