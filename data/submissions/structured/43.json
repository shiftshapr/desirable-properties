    "title": "The Algorithmic Collapse: Reclaiming Humanity in the Age of AI Slop",
    "overview": "This submission critiques the current trajectory of internet culture, shaped by a deluge of AI-generated content that mimics human creativity without its soul. It raises alarms about the degradation of trust, the erosion of digital authenticity, and the weaponization of engagement algorithms. It also highlights the need for systemic reevaluation: how we value creative labor, what constitutes \"real\" content, and the risks of unchecked AI proliferation in social, artistic, and journalistic domains. The human internet is not dead—but it's under siege. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",

      "why_it_matters": "As AI becomes ubiquitous, humanmade contributions risk becoming boutique rarities. If these disappear, so does the soul of digital culture."
