    "title": "Navigator User Interfaces (NUI) as a Coordination Layer for a Post-Search, Post-Feed Web",
    "overview": "This submission introduces Navigator User Interfaces (NUIs) as a new standard for customizable, shareable navigation tools across web-based tasks, educational flows, and collaborative work. NUIs propose a federated ecosystem of navigation frameworks allowing pluralistic learning, interaction, and AI-guided exploration, grounded in a shared regular panel. This enables remixable workflows while supporting agency, privacy, transparency, and ethical alignment. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",
