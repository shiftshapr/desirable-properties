    "title": "The Engineer's Ledger and the People-Centered Paraidox",
    "overview": "This submission presents a multifaceted synthesis of perspectives from an i4j town hall that explored how AI can serve human flourishing through pragmatic design, data dignity, and civic accountability. From Vint Cerf's empirical assessments to David Nordfors's VeMe concept, and from creative industry safeguards to behavioral science in HR, the discussion mapped the contours of a people-centered AI paradigm. The convergence across sectors—tech, policy, education, and entertainment—suggests a reframing of the so-called Paraidox: embracing AI to enhance, not replace, human intelligence. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3 and is based on the i4j town hall 'Harnessing AI for Productivity and Meaningful Work.'",
