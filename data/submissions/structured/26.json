    "title": "Mandatory Metadata for AI-Generated Artifacts",
    "overview": "This submission proposes a requirement that generative AI applications hosted on websites embed clear, machine-readable metadata in all digital artifacts they create—including podcasts, audio, video, images, and text—indicating that the content was generated by AI. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3",
