    "title": "Layered Transparency and Co-Presence for Metaweb Navigation",
    "overview": "This submission addresses five major problems on the web—false information, cognitive isolation, data exploitation, siloed knowledge, and value signal absence—by proposing overlay-based tools to augment transparency, collaboration, and data agency. These include 'fact-tag' systems, presence-aware overlays, data tracking awareness extensions, public notebooks, and trust-score visualizations. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",
