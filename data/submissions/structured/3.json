    "title": "UMi’s Contribution to the Meta-Layer Initiative: Sector-Specific Integration of DP4",
    "overview": "UMi proposes a sector-specific and civic infrastructure–based implementation of Desirable Property #4 (Data Sovereignty). This approach moves beyond conceptual alignment by embedding DP4 into active social, digital, and physical environments, rooted in lived expertise. The project anchors DP4 within UMi’s phygital civic economy, utilizing feedback loops and community-specific commentary to support its integration into educational, policy, and economic systems. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",
