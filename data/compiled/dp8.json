This would support coexistence of decentralized tools, prevent UX collisions, and empower users to customize their digital environment without friction.\n\nOverlays would be able to:\n- Register a “startup icon” and metadata (name, role, permissions)\n- Indicate availability or priority\n- Respect a shared system for tray placement and visibility\n- Defer to user preferences in display and ordering\n\nUsers could:\n- Configure which overlays are pinned or expanded\n- Access others on demand via an expandable tray\n- Rely on consistent placement and behavior across sites and browsers\n\nNext Steps: I suggest forming a W3C Community Group to define an open standard for overlay registration and tray coordination. This standard could help browsers and web apps harmonize decentralized UI layers, supporting both open innovation and excellent UX.",

First, in the school sector—particularly across Europe—project-based learning environments can integrate Meta-Layer tools to foster youth engagement with a safer, purpose-driven, and participatory web. Second, Scandinavia represents a particularly fertile region for a journalist-specific integration of the Meta-Layer. With strong traditions of collaborative civic culture, peaceful education systems, and relatively depolarized journalism ecosystems, countries like Denmark and Sweden could pioneer the use of a dedicated journalistic layer.

By embedding decentralized storage options into user interfaces, this approach enables user agency and sovereignty without requiring technical knowledge. This submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3.",

      "submission_overview": "This submission revisits the seminal 2001 vision of the Semantic Web, proposing its relevance and expanded applicability to modern decentralized meta-systems. It explores how the foundational architecture of the Semantic Web—built on distributed knowledge representation, interoperable ontologies, and machine-readable logic—prefigures the infrastructure needed for scalable, composable, and user-aligned digital environments. The submission identifies alignment with multiple Desirable Properties, especially regarding knowledge portability, participatory governance, and ethical agentic systems.
