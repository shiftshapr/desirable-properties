It proposes a post-extractive model of development where communities can co-create and maintain digital tools grounded in ceremony, kinship, and long-term care. Rather than maximizing speed or efficiency, these environments prioritize collective authorship, slow knowledge, and epistemic sovereignty. Dev environments become cultural environments.
