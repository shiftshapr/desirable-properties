This would support coexistence of decentralized tools, prevent UX collisions, and empower users to customize their digital environment without friction.\n\nOverlays would be able to:\n- Register a “startup icon” and metadata (name, role, permissions)\n- Indicate availability or priority\n- Respect a shared system for tray placement and visibility\n- Defer to user preferences in display and ordering\n\nUsers could:\n- Configure which overlays are pinned or expanded\n- Access others on demand via an expandable tray\n- Rely on consistent placement and behavior across sites and browsers\n\nNext Steps: I suggest forming a W3C Community Group to define an open standard for overlay registration and tray coordination. This standard could help browsers and web apps harmonize decentralized UI layers, supporting both open innovation and excellent UX.",

Most AI systems today — even those using RAG or agent-based architectures — lack persistent, intelligent memory. They retrieve information but don’t maintain continuity. DiCAMS solves this by generating a dynamic memory graph that grows and adapts with user input, real-world data, and contextual signals. Think of it as a scaffolded memory system that doesn’t just store — it organizes, summarizes, and forgets intelligently.\n\nWhere this matters most:\n- Healthcare: longitudinal patient data contextualization\n- Enterprise AI: evolving knowledge workflows\n- Agent ecosystems: shared context and alignment\n\nDiCAMS acts like a smart librarian — not only filing information but writing the index, linking the chapters, and updating the story as it unfolds. It’s not just a better retrieval system. It’s a meta-layer for cognition — the missing infrastructure for truly intelligent, user-aligned AI.\n\nThis submission was generated with protocol META-DP-EVAL-v1.3",

First, in the school sector—particularly across Europe—project-based learning environments can integrate Meta-Layer tools to foster youth engagement with a safer, purpose-driven, and participatory web. Second, Scandinavia represents a particularly fertile region for a journalist-specific integration of the Meta-Layer. With strong traditions of collaborative civic culture, peaceful education systems, and relatively depolarized journalism ecosystems, countries like Denmark and Sweden could pioneer the use of a dedicated journalistic layer.

      "submission_overview": "This proposal upgrades the familiar 'save as...' functionality into a Web3-native interaction—allowing users to save files directly to decentralized cloud storage such as IPFS. By embedding decentralized storage options into user interfaces, this approach enables user agency and sovereignty without requiring technical knowledge.

      "submission_overview": "This submission highlights two interlinked challenges: (1) current blockchain and Web3 product models are prohibitively expensive and culturally misaligned for crafts-producing communities in the Global South; (2) lack of interoperable standards risks reinforcing digital colonialism and undermining transformative policies like the EU's Green Deal. The author calls for early standardization and native interoperability, particularly around Digital Product Passports (DPPs), to empower bottom-up adoption and avoid top-down imposition.
